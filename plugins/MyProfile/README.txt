A simple plugin to add a 'My Profile' tab to the user profile with extended fields.

Installation
--------------------------------------------
In default.php, method Setup(), you can edit the columns that are defined in the database
BEFORE enabling in order to define the model implicitly.

Maintenance
--------------------------------------------
Short of some bug fixes, I won't be actively maintaining this plugin any more than features
I add as I use it for my site.  This isn't meant to be adversarial, merely honest.  Anyone
who wants to pick it up and create a more robust framework, feel free!  I'm happy to keep
track of versions, etc, but simply don't have time to accept feature requests from others.
